My project is a website comprised of four pages that share various information about Ruckus, the women's ultimate frisbee at UVM. 

The home page gives a general overview of what were about and has a link to our highlight reel from last season. It also has a side bar that shows our upcoming events

The roster page has a table with information on every player.

The coaches page introduces the coaches and shares some fun facts and photos

The tournamnts page is a list of our tournaments for the 2025-2026 season. The list items get darker when you hover over them.
